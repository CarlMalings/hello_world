# Carl's testing repository

This is my GitHub repository for testing things out.

The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository. 

I am interested in (among other things):
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and committing my changes.
- Merging the branch to main.
- Creating notebooks which can be run by anyone in Google Colab
